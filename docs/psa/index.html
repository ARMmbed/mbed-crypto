<p>This page contains technical information about the cryptography interfaces in the Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA) and related documents and software. For more information about the Platform Security Architecture, see <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/security-architectures/platform-security-architecture">the Arm Developer website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="application-programming-interface">Application programming interface</h2>
<p>The PSA Cryptography API is a C programming interface for applications that wish to store cryptographic keys and use them to perform cryptographic operations.</p>
<p><strong>Reference documentation</strong>: <a href="../html/index.html">HTML</a>, <a href="../PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<p><strong>Reference implementation</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tls">Mbed TLS</a></p>
<h2 id="hardware-abstraction-layer">Hardware abstraction layer</h2>
<h3 id="secure-element-driver-interface">Secure element driver interface</h3>
<p>The secure element driver interface lets you write drivers for external cryptoprocessors such as secure elements (SE), smart cards and hardware security modules (HSM) that perform operations on keys that never leave the external processor and are accessed only through opaque handles. You can plug such drivers into any implementation of the PSA Cryptography API.</p>
