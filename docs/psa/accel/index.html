<h1 id="psa-cryptographic-accelerator-interface">PSA cryptographic accelerator interface</h1>
<p>The cryptographic accelerator driver interface lets you write drivers for hardware that performs cryptographic operations with keys in clear text. You can plug such drivers into any implementation of the <a href="../#application-programming-interface">PSA Cryptography API</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Status: draft</strong> â€” major changes are still likely.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: for now, please see the header file: <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/blob/development/include/psa/crypto_accel_driver.h"><code>include/psa/crypto_accel_driver.h</code></a></p>
<p><strong>Mbed TLS support status</strong>: Not implemented yet. For now, accelerators use the <a href="https://tls.mbed.org/kb/development/hw_acc_guidelines">Mbed TLS alternative cryptography engine interface</a>.</p>
