# PSA cryptographic accelerator interface

The cryptographic accelerator driver interface lets you write drivers for hardware that performs cryptographic operations with keys in clear text.
You can plug such drivers into any implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](../#application-programming-interface).

**Status: draft** â€” major changes are still likely.

**Documentation**: for now, please see the header file:
[`include/psa/crypto_accel_driver.h`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/blob/development/include/psa/crypto_accel_driver.h)

**Mbed TLS support status**: Not implemented yet. For now, accelerators use the [Mbed TLS alternative cryptography engine interface](https://tls.mbed.org/kb/development/hw_acc_guidelines).
