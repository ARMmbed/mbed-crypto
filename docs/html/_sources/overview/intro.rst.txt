Introduction
------------

Armâ€™s Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a holistic set of threat models,
security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture specifications, an
open source firmware reference implementation, and an independent evaluation
and certification scheme. PSA provides a recipe, based on
industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at
both a hardware and firmware level.

The PSA Cryptographic API (Crypto API) described in this document is an
important PSA component that provides an interface to cryptographic operations
on resource-constrained devices. The interface is user-friendly, while still
providing access to the low-level primitives used in modern cryptography. It
does not require that the user has access to the key material. Instead, it uses
opaque key identifiers.

This document is part of the PSA family of specifications. It defines an
interface for cryptographic services, including cryptography primitives and a
key storage functionality.

This document includes:

-  A `rationale <design-goals>` for the design.
-  A `high-level overview of the functionality <functionality-overview>`
   provided by the interface.
-  A `description of typical architectures <architectures>` of
   implementations for this specification.
-  General considerations `for implementers <implementation-considerations>`
   of this specification and `for applications <usage-considerations>` that
   use the interface defined in this specification.
-  A `detailed definition <api-reference>` of the API.

Companion documents will define *profiles* for this specification. A profile is
a minimum mandatory subset of the interface that a compliant implementation must
provide.
